=====================
`mkl-service` changelog
=====================

2.3.0
=====

Fixed CI to actually execute tests. Populated CBWR constants to match MKL headers.
Added tests checking that `cbwr_set` and `cbwr_get` round-trip.

2.2.0
=====

Closed issues #8, #7 and #5. 

Extended `mkl.cbwr_set` to recognize `'avx512_e1'`, `'avx512_mic_e1'`, as as strict conditional numerical reproducibility, supported via `'avx2,strict'`, `'avx512,strict'` (see [issue/8](http://github.com/IntelPython/mkl-service/issues/8)).

Extended `mkl.cbwrt_get()` to mean `mkl.cbwr('all')`.

2.1.0
=====

Change in setup script to not use `numpy.distutils` thus removing numpy as build-time dependency.

Change in conda-recipe to allow conda build to build the recipe, but ignoring run export on mkl-service coming from mkl-devel metadata. 

2.0.2
=====

Correction to `setup.py` to not require Cython at the installation time.

2.0.1
=====

Re-release, with some changes necessary for public CI builds to work.

2.0.0
=====

Work-around for VS 9.0 not having `inline` keyword, allowing the package to build on Windows for Python 2.7

2.0.0
=====

Rerelease of `mkl-service` package with version bumped to 2.0.0 to avoid version clash with `mkl-service` package from Anaconda.

Improved argument checking, which raises an informative error.

Loading the package with `import mkl` initializes Intel(R) MKL library to use LP64 interface (i.e. use of environment variable `MKL_INTERFACE` will not have effect).

The choice of threading layer can be controlled with environment variable `MKL_THREADING_LAYER`. However the unset variable is interpreted differently that in Intel(R) MKL itself. If `mkl-service` detects that Gnu OpenMP has been loaded in Python space, the threading layer of Intle(R) MKL will be set to Gnu OpenMP, instead of Intel(R) OpenMP.

1.0.0
=====

Initial release of `mkl-service` package.
